# Praxis

![Praxis](assets/hero.png)

*From Greek: the process of putting ideas into practice.*

A complete AI-assisted development workflow, packaged as portable agent skills and sub-agents. Praxis implements a structured development cycle — from idea to production code to documented learnings — designed to make each cycle of work improve the next. The name reflects what this workflow is about: not just thinking or just doing, but the disciplined cycle of idea → practice → reflection that makes each iteration better than the last.

This workflow mirrors how I personally develop software — brainstorm until the idea is clear, plan concretely before touching code, implement with discipline, review rigorously, and always look back to learn. Praxis encodes that process so AI agents can follow it consistently.

Inspired by [Every's Compound Engineering guide](https://every.to/guides/compound-engineering) and its core principle: **every unit of engineering work should make subsequent units easier, not harder.**

### Why Praxis?

**Project and technology agnostic.** Praxis is not tied to any language, framework, or tech stack. It works with any codebase — drop it into an Elixir project, a React app, a Rust CLI, or a Rails monolith. The skills describe *how to work*, not *what to work on*.

**Context window efficient.** Every design decision respects the limited context window of AI agents. Templates are loaded on demand through progressive disclosure, not upfront. Research runs in parallel sub-agents that return summaries instead of polluting the main thread. Shared conventions live in one file, referenced by many. The goal: spend tokens on the real work, not on infrastructure.

**Tool agnostic.** No dependency on a specific AI coding tool. Skills and agents use standard markdown with YAML frontmatter, compatible with [Amp](https://ampcode.com), [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com), and similar tools.

## The Cycle

```
brainstorming → planning → implementing → reviewing → retrospective
      ↑                                                      │
      └──────────────── learnings feed back ─────────────────┘
```

1. **Brainstorming** — Explore ideas through conversation. No code, no technical details. Output: idea files.
2. **Planning** — Turn an idea into concrete, actionable implementation plans. Parallel sub-agents research the codebase, past learnings, and external best practices. Output: plan files.
3. **Implementing** — Execute a plan step by step, committing meaningful units of work. Output: code on a feature branch.
4. **Reviewing** — Run configurable reviewer agents in parallel against the changed code. Findings are presented, not auto-fixed. Output: prioritized review findings.
5. **Retrospective** — Analyze completed work, capture specific learnings. Output: learning files that feed back into future brainstorming and planning sessions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- An AI coding agent that supports skills/agents (e.g., [Amp](https://ampcode.com), [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) (`rg`) — fast text search
- [ast-grep](https://github.com/ast-grep/ast-grep) (`sg`) — structural/AST-aware code search (optional, recommended)

### Installation

The recommended way to install Praxis is via the CLI (requires Node.js 18+):

```bash
npx github:coverflex-tech/praxis init
```

This creates the `.agents/` directory with all Praxis skills and agents, sets up `.ai-workflow/` directories, and writes a `.praxis-manifest.json` file to track installed files. Commit `.praxis-manifest.json` to version control so the CLI can detect changes on future updates.

#### Tool-specific install (Cursor, Claude)

To have Praxis work natively in a specific AI tool, pass optional flags to `init` (or `update`). Each flag creates or refreshes that tool’s directory (e.g. `.cursor/`, `.claude/`) from `.agents/` so the tool sees the same layout with no manual steps.

```bash
npx github:coverflex-tech/praxis init -- --cursor --claude
```

When using `npx`, put the tool flags **after** `--` so they are passed to the script. Supported flags:

- `--cursor` — Add or refresh Cursor support (`.cursor/`)
- `--claude` — Add or refresh Claude support (`.claude/`)
- `--opencode` — Not yet supported; the CLI will exit with a clear message and link to this repo for status.
- `--force` — Overwrite existing tool dirs if they already have content (otherwise the command fails and tells you to run `update` or remove the dir first).

With no tool flags, `init` and `update` behave as before (only `.agents/` and `.ai-workflow/` are managed).

To update to the latest version:

```bash
npx github:coverflex-tech/praxis update
```

The update command fetches the latest files from the Praxis repo's main branch, applies changes, and prompts you before overwriting any files you've locally modified. If your manifest lists tool dirs (from a previous `init --cursor` or `init --claude`), `update` also refreshes those dirs from `.agents/`. You can pass `--cursor` or `--claude` to `update` to add a new tool to an already-initialized project.

To check the status of managed files:

```bash
npx github:coverflex-tech/praxis status
```

#### Exit codes and errors

- **0** — Success.
- **1** — Runtime error (e.g. not initialized, permission or disk failure, tool dir already present without `--force`). Error message is written to stderr with an actionable suggestion.
- **2** — Usage error (e.g. invalid flag). Message on stderr.

Scripts can rely on the exit code and stderr for automation.

#### Manual installation

If you don't use Node.js, copy the `.agents/` directory into your project:

```bash
cp -r path/to/praxis/.agents your-project/.agents
```

Note that manual copies won't receive automatic updates.

#### Troubleshooting

- **"Run praxis init first"** — You're in a project that has no `.praxis-manifest.json`. Run `npx github:coverflex-tech/praxis init` (optionally with `-- --cursor` or `-- --claude`) in the project root.
- **"Tool dir already present"** — The target directory (e.g. `.cursor/`) already has Praxis content. Use `praxis update` to refresh it, or remove the directory and run `init` again. To overwrite in place, use `--force`.
- **"OpenCode is not yet supported"** — The `--opencode` flag is reserved for a future release. Use `--cursor` and/or `--claude` for now.

### Usage

Invoke skills by name through your AI agent:

```
/skill brainstorming a better way to handle user onboarding
/skill planning .ai-workflow/ideas/20260222-user-onboarding.md
/skill implementing .ai-workflow/plans/20260222-user-onboarding-phase-1.md
/skill reviewing staged
/skill retrospective .ai-workflow/plans/20260222-user-onboarding-phase-1.md
```

## Customization

### Adding project-specific reviewers

Drop a `.md` file into `.agents/agents/reviewers/`. The reviewing skill discovers and runs all reviewers in that directory automatically. Follow the output format in `.agents/reviewer-output-format.md`.

Example: create `.agents/agents/reviewers/elixir-conventions.md` for Elixir-specific checks.

### Removing default reviewers

Delete any reviewer file you don't need. For example, remove `data-integrity.md` if your project doesn't use a database.

### Tags

All documents (ideas, plans, learnings) share a single tag registry at `.ai-workflow/tags`. Tags are maintained automatically — the skills read existing tags before assigning new ones to keep vocabulary consistent.

### File templates

Templates for ideas, plans, and learnings live in `reference/template.md` under each skill directory. Modify them to match your team's preferences.

## Design Principles

- **Compounding knowledge** — Retrospective learnings feed back into brainstorming and planning, so the system gets smarter with each cycle.
- **Traceability** — Every plan links to its idea, every learning links to its plan. Status fields track documents through the full lifecycle.
- **Configurability** — Reviewers are discoverable by convention. Add or remove them per project without changing any configuration.
